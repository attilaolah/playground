Things that don't have a better home just yet.

## History: 2024

Much of the contents of this repo from 2024 are an attempt to build Talos for i686 / i386 systems. While most of it
works, with minimal patches, eventially I gave up as I replaced all of my i686 hardware with x86_64 or arm64 machines.
